              <h2>Skin Care</h2>
              <h4>Abigayle Wynsma, October 13, 2021</h4>

              <p>It’s no surprise that taking care of yourself helps in every aspect of one’s life. However, our largest organ, skin, may be the most neglected- despite it being the outermost part of our inner beauty. It’s something I know I’ve failed to care for in the past. Nevertheless, once I realized how much better taking care of my skin made me feel, I haven’t turned back. Here is my skin care routine and what I’ve learned to hopefully help give some insight to those who don’t know where to start.</p>
              <h3>Step 1: Remove dirt or makeup, then use cleanser</h3>
                <p>I am guilty of leaving my makeup on before I went to sleep, but each time I’ve regretted it in the morning. Take some kind of makeup remover, and follow it up with a cleanser of your choice. I prefer the CeraVe Salicylic Acid wash.</p>
              <h3>Step 2: Use Toner</h3>  
                <p>One of my secret weapons I’ve used for years is taking witch hazel, or any facial astringent, and wipe off any excess dirt, makeup, etc. after cleansing. This really make sures your pores are cleaned thoroughly. </p>
              <h3>Step 3: Aloe Vera</h3>
                <p>For the past 6 years I have not missed putting aloe vera on my face. It’s natural, and kills excess bacteria laying on the skin. Be careful of which brand you use, and try your best to get a super pure aloe gel with no dye.</p>
              <h3>Step 4: Moisturize</h3>
                <p>I am always surprised at how many people skip this step! Even if you have oily skin, applying moisturizer is super important (and they make special kinds for oily skin as well!) This protects your skin from allergens and any outside debris that is harmful to your skin.</p>
